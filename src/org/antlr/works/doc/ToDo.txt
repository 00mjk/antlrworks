* Prio 1
- sort rules should keep current selected rule in tree
- fix tree appearance between interpreter and debugger on Windows
- tokenVocab (of course, its for me *.tokens)
- XJAlert: insert auto new line if line too long
- contextual menu to export to bitmap/eps
- update the update manager settings for the new mac os x package
- update web site with new information + videos

* Prio 2
- test on ANTLR v3 examples
- do example calculator ANTLR intro (tree): convert to 3.0 and use AW with it (try to figure out
  the debugging part of all this)
- DFA decision for lexer tokens (see with Terence) - position in lexer grammar

- ideas: undefined rule: rename rule, delete token
- prefs: customizable list of "Insert Rule From Template" - or read from a file ?

* Prio 3:
- jump into source when navigating grammar text (in generated code)
- display current token in syntax diagram
- display multiple rules together
- (Terence will change) handle "header with package" option (see with Terence for line numbering between files)
- use Grammar randomText to generate random valid input text
- lexical ambiguities (ask Terence)
- do something with verbose in ErrorListener later
- if emacs is set (in preferences), disable all conflicting menu in Linux/Windows
- optimize state arround external ref (negative state should be removed - see if it is always possible)
- jump to a definition by double-click in the syntax diagram
- problem when more than one same LT between mark/rewind

- traduire en francais en_US.stg dans /tool/templates/messages
- extract all strings into properties

* Check-list *

- version in about.properties
- version in strings.properties
- remove private menu
- optimize imports
- check update.xml file

- package for Mac OS X
- upload antlrworks.pdf

JavaC Windows Classpath example: C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.5.0_03\\bin\\javac

* Issues *

- interpreter tree doesn't display correctly (but debugger tree does)
- use "load" on Linux/Windows when opening a document on an untouched one
- tree view of TUsage: why use white spaces to be able to display the entire string ?
