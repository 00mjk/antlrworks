* Prio 1
- prefs: syntax coloring colors in prefs
- change color of $
- create grammar file in project
- mantra extension is now .om
- test debug+generate+project build on Linux/Windows

- ask for string literal for T104 (Tokens artificial SD) -> nameOfExternalReferencedRule() in FAFactory
- stats on grammar (show k or inf on each decision)
- show code for any decision (Ter ads comments in code)
- from generated code, jump back to grammar

* Prio 2
- DFA decision for lexer tokens (see with Terence) - position in lexer grammar
- prefs: customizable list of "Insert Rule From Template" - or read from a file ?
- extract all strings into properties
- jump into source when navigating grammar text (in generated code)
- display current token in syntax diagram
- handle "header with package" option (see with Terence for line numbering between files)
- lexical ambiguities (ask Terence)

* Check-list *

- version in about.properties
- version in strings.properties
- remove private menu
- optimize imports
- check update.xml file
- tests: check grammar, interpreter, debugger

- package for Mac OS X
- upload antlrworks.pdf

JavaC Windows Classpath example: C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.5.0_03\\bin\\javac

* Issues *

- jikes doesn't work from within a jar
- use "load" on Linux/Windows when opening a document on an untouched one
- tree view of TUsage: why use white spaces to be able to display the entire string ?
