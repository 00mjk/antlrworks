Now:

- interpreter tree doesn't display correctly (but debugger tree does)
- use "load" on Linux/Windows when opening a document on an untouched one
- remember last interpreter start symbol

- geographical info
- GUI stats
- ANTLR stats fetcher
- stats reporter
- think about the Mac OS X packaging
- XJ: pouvoir indiquer la version de l'application

Terence:
- problems with SD: a : ((A)*)*;

Check-list:
- version in SplashScreen.java
- version in about.properties
- version in info.properties
- remove private menu

Test

Issues:
- TextEditorPane: wrapping doesn't always works on Mac OS X
- undo: rename + addition -> redo doesn't show "rename" but "addition"

Later:
- optimize state arround external ref (negative state should be removed - see if it is always possible)
- auto-scrolling when following ambiguous paths
- sort content of auto-completion menu
- sort content of rules/tokens table
- can change L&F
- display LT in blue when exiting an alt (see Terence's email)
- find
- goto dialog
- show line number in gutter (via preferences and notification)
- background for stepped line like in IntelliJ (jaune clair) - handle also debugger cursor when in use
- debugger: implements input stream breakpoint
- jump to a definition by double-click in the syntax diagram
- split list between tokens (MAJ) and rules (min)
- log file (check in preferences)
- localization of all strings in properties file ?

- problem when more than one same LT between mark/rewind
