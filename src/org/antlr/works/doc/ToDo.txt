- cannot inline ID in smtp grammar!
- include path to javac in preferences (use default javac or this path)
- include new EpsEngine in the depot

- contextual menus on rules to group using selected rules (do not rely on text selection)
- ideas: undefined rule: rename rule, delete token
- P4: if file read-only and under P4, propose to open for edit
- check environment (see e-mail from Jim Idle)

- breakpoint on input text
- display current token in syntax diagram
- generate code without debugging information
- shift-right, shift-left, comment/uncomment selection
- display multiple rules together

- DFA decision for lexer tokens (see with Terence)
- handle "header with package" option (see with Terence for line numbering between files)
- display all literals in list
- use Grammar randomText to generate random valid input text

- lexical ambiguities (ask Terence)

- traduire en francais en_US.stg dans /tool/templates/messages
- extract all strings into properties

* Check-list *

- version in about.properties
- version in strings.properties
- remove private menu
- optimize imports
- check update.xml file

- upload antlrworks.pdf

* Issues *

- interpreter tree doesn't display correctly (but debugger tree does)
- use "load" on Linux/Windows when opening a document on an untouched one
- tree view of TUsage: why use white spaces to be able to display the entire string ?

* ToDo *

- reduce the height of each parse tree view
- versioning in the prefs
- better message when cannot connect because null id (submit statistics)
- do something with verbose in ErrorListener later
- if emacs is set (in preferences), disable all conflicting menu in Linux/Windows
- contextual menu in the editor (go to declaration, rename, etc)
- update manager for stringtemplate/antlr
- download stringtemplate/antlr if not found
- make update manager aware of specific OS (i.e. Mac OS X packaging different from Linux/Windows)
- optimize state arround external ref (negative state should be removed - see if it is always possible)
- auto-scrolling when following ambiguous paths
- show line number in gutter (via preferences and notification)
- jump to a definition by double-click in the syntax diagram

- problem when more than one same LT between mark/rewind

* Short-cuts *

- control-t : invoke template completion
