- automatic completion based on existing rule and existing token (i.e an undefined reference to rule
  should appear in the auto-completion menu). Also, do not propose a rule when typing the name of
  a rule otherwise it will be duplicated.
- maintain auto-indentation
- terminate menu refactoring: put Find/Refactor in new menu classes
- remove left recursion: be careful with blabla+ (do not put a space between a and +)

- test with empty preferences file
- P4: if file read-only and under P4, propose to open for edit
- SCM: add diff
- display all literals in list
- use Grammar randomText to generate random valid input text
- @todo in grammar and panel to recapitulate (also for undefined and duplicated rules)
- message pour indiquer lorsque le syntax diagram n'est pas affiche (comme par exemple sur les regles du lexer)
- syntax coloring delay in preferences
- check environment (see e-mail from Jim Idle)

- lexical ambiguities (ask Terence)
- LT are not always displayed - see if we are too restricting

- traduire en francais en_US.stg dans /tool/templates/messages
- extract all strings into properties

* Check-list *

- version in about.properties
- version in strings.properties
- remove private menu
- optimize imports
- check update.xml file

- upload antlrworks.pdf

* Issues *

- interpreter tree doesn't display correctly (but debugger tree does)
- use "load" on Linux/Windows when opening a document on an untouched one
- tree view of TUsage: why use white spaces to be able to display the entire string ?

- TextEditorPane: wrapping doesn't always works on Mac OS X
- undo: rename + addition -> redo doesn't show "rename" but "addition"

* ToDo *

- reduce the height of each parse tree view
- versioning in the prefs
- better message when cannot connect because null id (submit statistics)
- do something with verbose in ErrorListener later
- if emacs is set (in preferences), disable all conflicting menu in Linux/Windows
- contextual menu in the editor (go to declaration, rename, etc)
- minimum font size 12 in sd (then ... and mouse over -> show full name)
- update manager for stringtemplate/antlr
- download stringtemplate/antlr if not found
- make update manager aware of specific OS (i.e. Mac OS X packaging different from Linux/Windows)
- optimize state arround external ref (negative state should be removed - see if it is always possible)
- auto-scrolling when following ambiguous paths
- sort content of auto-completion menu
- display LT in blue when exiting an alt (see Terence's email)
- show line number in gutter (via preferences and notification)
- debugger: implements input stream breakpoint
- jump to a definition by double-click in the syntax diagram
- log file (check in preferences)
- localization of all strings in properties file ?

- problem when more than one same LT between mark/rewind

* Short-cuts *

- control-t : invoke template completion
