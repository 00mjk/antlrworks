Now:
- problem when more than one same LT between mark/rewind
- interpreter loops when bad input (i.e. java code for SimpleGrammar)
- look at making the interpreter working for a simple grammar
- undo: rename + addition -> redo doesn't show "rename" but "addition"

Release in May:
- | is not recolored when typed after a token
- check copy/cut keyboard filter on Windows/Linux
- performance of debugger (when playing all events from start to end - takes too much time)

- center the text when stepping with the debugger
- can change L&F
- optimize state arround external ref (negative state should be removed - see if it is always possible)
- remove observer from notification when closing window

Test
- Windows/Linux: short-cuts, gutter position

Issues:
- TextEditorPane: wrapping doesn't always works on Mac OS X

Later:
- find
- goto dialog
- debugger: tokenize the input
- show line number in gutter (via preferences and notification)
- background for stepped line like in IntelliJ (jaune clair) - handle also debugger cursor when in use
- debugger: implements input stream breakpoint
- jump to a definition by double-click in the syntax diagram
- split list between tokens (MAJ) and rules (min)
- log file (check in preferences)

Terence:
- add an event when exiting a rule (location)
- add missing first state for error paths
