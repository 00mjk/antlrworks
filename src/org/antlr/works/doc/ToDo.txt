Questions:
- redo every error redirection (and exception stack trace) to the console
- DFA decision for lexer tokens (see with Terence) - position in lexer grammar

* Prio 1
- tokenVocab (of course, its for me *.tokens)

* Prio 2
- adopt new ANTLR grammar format (" and @)
- test on ANTLR v3 examples
- do example calculator ANTLR intro (tree): convert to 3.0 and use AW with it (try to figure out
  the debugging part of all this)

- re-check the console
- generate code without debugging information

- ideas: undefined rule: rename rule, delete token
- P4: if file read-only and under P4, propose to open for edit
- check environment (see e-mail from Jim Idle)
- prefs: customizable list of "Insert Rule From Template" - or read from a file ?

* Prio 3:
- jump into source when navigating grammar text (in generated code)
- Windows/Linux: don't quit if last document closed ?
- display current token in syntax diagram
- shift-right, shift-left, comment/uncomment selection
- display multiple rules together

- (Terence will change) handle "header with package" option (see with Terence for line numbering between files)
- use Grammar randomText to generate random valid input text
- lexical ambiguities (ask Terence)

- traduire en francais en_US.stg dans /tool/templates/messages
- extract all strings into properties

* Check-list *

- version in about.properties
- version in strings.properties
- remove private menu
- optimize imports
- check update.xml file

- upload antlrworks.pdf

JavaC Windows Classpath example: C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.5.0_03\\bin\\javac

* Issues *

- interpreter tree doesn't display correctly (but debugger tree does)
- use "load" on Linux/Windows when opening a document on an untouched one
- tree view of TUsage: why use white spaces to be able to display the entire string ?

* ToDo *

- versioning in the prefs
- better message when cannot connect because null id (submit statistics)
- do something with verbose in ErrorListener later
- if emacs is set (in preferences), disable all conflicting menu in Linux/Windows
- contextual menu in the editor (go to declaration, rename, etc)
- update manager for stringtemplate/antlr
- download stringtemplate/antlr if not found
- make update manager aware of specific OS (i.e. Mac OS X packaging different from Linux/Windows)
- optimize state arround external ref (negative state should be removed - see if it is always possible)
- auto-scrolling when following ambiguous paths
- show line number in gutter (via preferences and notification)
- jump to a definition by double-click in the syntax diagram

- problem when more than one same LT between mark/rewind
