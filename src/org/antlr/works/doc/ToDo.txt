Now:

- verify all erase file on the disk

- linux: cannot use ctrl-k to hide action because it is used for emacs binding
- windows: short-cut for Debug command doesn't work

- performance of debugger (when playing all events from start to end - takes too much time)
- remove all ToDos

- optimize state arround external ref (negative state should be removed - see if it is always possible)

Terence:
- problems with SD: a : ((A)*)*;

Test
- linux: remove grid lines in rules/tokens table
- Windows/Linux: short-cuts, gutter position
- success dialog after generation: does not stay modal on Linux (see if parent)
- check copy/cut keyboard filter on Windows/Linux
- windows/linux: compiler using exec()
- windows/linux: check preferences font & size (see if default is ugly)

Issues:
- TextEditorPane: wrapping doesn't always works on Mac OS X
- undo: rename + addition -> redo doesn't show "rename" but "addition"

Later:
- auto-scrolling when following ambiguous paths
- sort content of auto-completion menu
- sort content of rules/tokens table
- can change L&F
- display LT in blue when exiting an alt (see Terence's email)
- find
- goto dialog
- show line number in gutter (via preferences and notification)
- background for stepped line like in IntelliJ (jaune clair) - handle also debugger cursor when in use
- debugger: implements input stream breakpoint
- jump to a definition by double-click in the syntax diagram
- split list between tokens (MAJ) and rules (min)
- log file (check in preferences)

- problem when more than one same LT between mark/rewind
