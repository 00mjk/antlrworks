- XJURLLabel: check license
- MultilineToolTip : grab license and see if correct
- BrowserLauncher: ok (mail from author)

- traduire en francais en_US.stg dans /tool/templates/messages
- extract all strings into properties

* Check-list *

- version in about.properties
- version in strings.properties
- remove private menu
- optimize imports
- check update.xml file

- upload antlrworks.pdf

* Issues *

- interpreter tree doesn't display correctly (but debugger tree does)
- use "load" on Linux/Windows when opening a document on an untouched one

- TextEditorPane: wrapping doesn't always works on Mac OS X
- undo: rename + addition -> redo doesn't show "rename" but "addition"

* ToDo *

- do something with verbose in ErrorListener later
- if emacs is set (in preferences), disable all conflicting menu in Linux/Windows
- contextual menu in the editor (go to declaration, rename, etc)
- fix bug when selecting an alternate path (if this one is not the current one)
- minimum font size 12 in sd (then ... and mouse over -> show full name)
- update manager for stringtemplate/antlr
- download stringtemplate/antlr if not found
- make update manager aware of specific OS (i.e. Mac OS X packaging different from Linux/Windows)
- optimize state arround external ref (negative state should be removed - see if it is always possible)
- auto-scrolling when following ambiguous paths
- sort content of auto-completion menu
- sort content of rules/tokens table
- can change L&F
- display LT in blue when exiting an alt (see Terence's email)
- find
- goto dialog
- show line number in gutter (via preferences and notification)
- background for stepped line like in IntelliJ (jaune clair) - handle also debugger cursor when in use
- debugger: implements input stream breakpoint
- jump to a definition by double-click in the syntax diagram
- split list between tokens (MAJ) and rules (min)
- log file (check in preferences)
- localization of all strings in properties file ?

- problem when more than one same LT between mark/rewind

* Short-cuts *

- control-t : invoke template completion
